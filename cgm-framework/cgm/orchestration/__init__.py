"""cgm.orchestration — the ``cgm`` CLI verbs (the main agent's control surface).

The verbs ``list`` / ``new`` / ``assign`` / ``start`` / ``status`` / ``stop`` that
scaffold a project, hand each worker its per-round assignment, and start / monitor
/ stop the autonomous loops. The loop + on-disk layout they drive live in
``cgm.execution``; this module is the verbs/UX only.

Run as ``python -m cgm.orchestration`` (this is what ``bin/cgm`` execs).
